Just walked out of The Woman in the Yard and it's like my brain's been thrown into a washing machine but—it’s the best way, like the  's still spinning me around. Noisy theater buzz fading but that eerie silence from the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮’s last scene still echoing in my ears. My back ache's from the lumpy seats, a malicious shadow itself, ugh.

Can't shake off the woman’s gaze when she turns around in slo-mo, you know the bit? It’s like she stared at ME, popcorn crumbs tumbling from my lap in shock. Random folks shuffling out asking where to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  —who even are these people???

> But it's like, the sound design was as if you wrapped loneliness in a whisper-thin sheet of velvet, yet somehow thorny? And then the scene with the red balloon—couldn't even focus because some guy sneezed loudly behind me but it melded into the ambiance. Probably not intentional but my brain stitched it together, a perfect quilt of chaos.

And that one chase through the messy yard had my pulse racing, like when you’re panic searching for your keys at night, only instead of keys, it’s urgency you're trying to catch. The music was there in my chest, like it hooked its notes to my heartstrings, plucking away.

Someone on the way out brushed their arm against mine, and for a split second, I felt the protagonist’s fear? Haunted me. It’s like she left bits of her soul scattered outside that yard, and the theater was part of the puzzle.

To 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   again, is it like stepping into the same river twice? I know, makes no sense—sort of like when that random dog barked during a silent tearful scene, completely off-script. Wasn't a pivotal dog moment...or maybe it was, who am I to say.

Typing from this bench and my fingers refuse to cooperate, damned popcorn grease or something. If you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it, prepare for life to feel a bit skewed afterward, like using a slightly off-kilter pair of binoculars.

Somebody once asked if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Maybe after you try to untangle the plot strings, but good luck with that literal yard of mysteries.
